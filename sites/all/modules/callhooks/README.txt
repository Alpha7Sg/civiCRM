This is just example code to implement custom hooks for CiviCRM.

Each custom hook defined by CiviCRM is implemented here.

To use:

1. Install this module or incorporate its code into your own custom module.
2. Uncomment some/all the watchdog lines.
3. Visit the page you need to modify via a CiviCRM custom hook.
4. Re-comment the watchdog lines.
5. Visit admin/reports/dblog and look at the comments there.
6. Write a function as described by one of the comments.
